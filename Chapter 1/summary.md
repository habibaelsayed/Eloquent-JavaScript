# Chapter 1
### Values:
- Working with bits we must separate them into `chunks` that reperesent pieces of information these are called (values)

### Numbers:
- JavaScript uses fixed number of bits, 64 of them, to store a single number value.
- you need to worry about `overflow` only when dealing with truly astronomical numbers.

### Arithmetic:
- The main thing to do with numbers is arithmetic. (Arithmetic operations)
- The '+' and '*' symbols are called `operators`.
- When operators appear together without parentheses, the order in which they are applied is determined by the `precedence` of the operators.

### Special Numbers:
- There are three special values are considered in JavaScript as numbers but don't behave like normal numbers --> Infinity, -Infinity, NaN (not a number).
- You will get result `NaN` when calculationg '0/0' or 'Infinity - Infinity' or any number of other numeric operations that don't yield a (meaningful) result.
